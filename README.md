# Glassdoor Salary Prediction
This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to predict salaries based on job descriptions and company information from Glassdoor. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training using multiple algorithms, and evaluation.

--

## Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed Glassdoor salary data
- Performed EDA with visual insights
- Trained multiple regression models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- Visualized actual vs predicted salaries
- Saved the final model for deployment

-- 

## Models Used
- Linear Regression — Simple baseline model
- Decision Tree Regressor — Captures nonlinear relationships
- Random Forest Regressor — Best performing ensemble model

--

## Results
- Random Forest had the best performance:
  R² Score: ~0.91
  Low MAE and RMSE compared to other models
- Visual comparison of actual vs predicted salaries showed good alignment
